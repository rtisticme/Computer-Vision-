For Face Detection
Viola Jones algorithm :
It is the most powerful algorithm for computer vision ( to date 2017 ) developed in 2001
It is used for real time face detection
It has two stages
1. Traning 
2. Detection

Detection 
The rgb image is converted to grayscale and the algorithm starts to look for various 
features ( like nose, eye brows, lips ... etc)
It does this with f a sub-window that sweeps across the images looking at various features.
(The size of the sub-window(box) may vary)

Haar-lIke features 
-Edge features (Eye Brows)
-Line features (Lips)
-Four rectangle Features

These are the features which help to identify differet part of the faces based on 
cahge is intensity of pixel changes with in the image

Threshold is set on the basis of the value given by B-W = value (Black-White (0.568-0.166)) 
where 0-100% white 
      1-100% black 
For line feature both min and max threshold need to be set
Say for a nose B-W = 0.402 
so we can set ( If T>0.3 identify the feature as a nose 
else the feature doesnot identify a nose)

Integral Feature ( A hack for haar like features to make the process simples)
To find B and W value we have to find the avg value for individual pixels which can be heavy for larger images so we 
use this method which brings the no of need points to only four values even htough there are 1000 of indiviual pixel values

Traning classifiers
- The algorithm works by resizing an image to 24*24 px
and scaling the individual features.
We train by using 1000 of face and non- face (to solve the problem of false positive)

Adaptive boositve 
this is done to make traning more efficient as the total no of features with in a face can be 
180,000+ even in 24*24 px image
So 
F(x) (Strong classifier) = a1f1(x)(weak classifer) + a2f2(x)+ ....
where the strong classifer is the toatl sum of many weak calssifiers put together
F(x)= Strong feature (60%) + The feature that compliments the strong feature + ... fixing weakneasses with in a strong feature

Cascading (A hack for adaptive boosting to make the algorithm efficient) 
It rejects the other features in sequences (complimenting features) when a ceratin feature is no found
It is risky as it is based on a single feature to reject all the other features
